# Client
client folder contains react code. I use redux and redux-saga for state management,\
react-router-dom to handle client side routing and material-ui as a UI framework.

# server
I use jest for testing, joi for validation, passport-jwt and 0auth2 for authentication,\
mongoose driver for mongodb and signale for logging.
